                <section class="description">
                    “EquSol” is an android calculation app that is useful for students, teachers as well as research-related work. We engineers have to perform lots of calculations but there is no such calculator that is developed keeping in mind about engineers or for researchers as they have to perform large calculations and also wants all the important operations at their fingertips. I have developed and designed a calculator application named “EquSol” that can solve both linear equations up to 25 unknown variables and polynomial equations up to the highest degree of 25. All the necessary operations that are usually used by engineers will be at their fingertips.You can visit my github page by clicking on this <a href="https://github.com/Manash-Das/Equsol">link</a> for further details.<br>
                    <p>This project got published in a journal <i>"IJIREEICE"</i> International Journal of Innovative Research in Electrical, Electronics, Instrumentation and Control Engineering under the mentorship of <b>Sulekha Das </b> Assistant Prof. Dept. of CSE.You can read this by clicking on this <a href="https://ijireeice.com/papers/building-an-app-that-can-provide-solutions-to-large-equations/">link</a> or direct downlaod <a href="https://ijireeice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IJIREEICE.2022.10317.pdf">link</a>.</p>
